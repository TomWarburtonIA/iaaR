Description: Indoor air analysis can be quite complex! Aside from the chemistry involved, target gases and sampling rigs are often required, as well as complex data visualisation. These functions won't make everything easy, but will hopefully at least help with some aspects of it! If you find any issues or bugs, then please let me know by raising a question on GitHub or by emailing me at tw1580@york.ac.uk.
